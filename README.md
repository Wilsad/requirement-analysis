# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
ðŸ“Œ Requirement Analysis in software development is the process of defining, analysing, and documenting what a software system should do and what constraints it must operate under. It's essentially the blueprinting stage before any code is written. This directory is a blueprint for a detailed requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasising clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is basically what a system needs to do and the conditions it must satisfy to be successful. It's essentially about defining the "what" before jumping into the "how.
Hereâ€™s why itâ€™s essential in the SDLC:
- Reduces development cost by minimising rework due to misunderstood needs
- Improves client satisfaction by delivering what was truly needed
- Ensures better collaboration across teams through shared understanding
- Provides clear benchmarks for testing and validation
- Enhances product quality by aligning development with real-world use cases

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
ðŸ§  Key Reasons
- Clarify what the client or end-user wants
- Convert vague ideas into structured, testable requirements
- Lay a concrete foundation for development and testing
- Avoid miscommunication and scope creep
